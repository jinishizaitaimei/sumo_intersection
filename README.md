# Signal Control Simulator_v1 @SWJTU WAVES LAB

  An intersection located in the High-tech Zone, Chengdu, Sichuan, China, was simulated for testing RL/non-RL models of signal control via the **SUMO** platform.

  Multiple scenarios, including adverse weather, lane closures, and priority passing of emergency vehicles, were added.
